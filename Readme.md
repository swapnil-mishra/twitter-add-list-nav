####Chrome plugin to add "Lists" navigation item to Twitter navigation

Being a freequent twitter list user i always wanted to have one click access to my lists on twitter home page. This chrome extenstion/plugin tries to do that by adding a navigation item named "Lists" on twitter's main navigation.

Alernatively, this can also serve as tiny boilerplace code if you wish to work on a chrome extension.

_Below is an animated gif showing how to install it._
